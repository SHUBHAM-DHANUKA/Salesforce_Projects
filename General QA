Qustion: How to get a particular record id and update that record through trigger ?

Ans:  It is something created by salesforce itself 
While inserting record, record id gets generated 
While creating component, id gets generated 
While getting response, a particular response id there.

Question: Apex Direct field is showing or accessing in component 
Answer:   U can do that just define the attribute of that object type and pass that object attribute as a reference to the server controller. 

Aura Controller: yes u can directly use Object fields 
And pass entire object as a parameter in server controller 


In the apex page there is also this thing there.   
And it also provides a standard action method to handle the basic tasks. 

But it's not a recommended approach to assign value directly to the object field or to expose field api name.
